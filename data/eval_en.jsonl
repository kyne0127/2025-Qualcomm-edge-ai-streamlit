Incident Overview\nAt a lithium primary battery factory in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province, a series of explosions triggered a large-scale fire,\nresulting in 23 deaths and 8 injuries. This marked a major industrial disaster with heavy casualties among migrant workers.\n2. Causes and Sequence (Investigation/Administrative Findings)\nAn explosion occurred in a 2nd-floor workspace, spreading rapidly due to the presence of approx. 35,000 batteries. Toxic smoke\nand successive explosions exacerbated damage. Government ordered full investigation and plant shutdown\n3. Reporting and Initial Response\nMassive deployment of firefighting and rescue personnel/equipment. Fire point access restricted; re-ignition risk monitored.\nMissing persons searched.\n4. Rescue and Emergency Response\nDespite continuous explosions and toxic smoke, search and recovery operations were carried out. Bodies recovered, survivors\ntreated and transported, site stabilized.\n5. Agency Roles\n• Fire Department: Suppression, search, removal of combustibles.\n• Police & Labor Authorities: Raids, investigations of law violations.\n• Local & Central Government: Designation as a key management facility, policy reforms.\n6. On-Site Safety/Response Guidelines (Key Points)\nLithium and water-reactive material fires require special extinguishing agents; water use is restricted. Storage/workspaces\nmust be separated; overstock prohibited. Mandatory sprinklers, detectors, and evacuation routes. Temporary storage must have\nexplosion-proofing and ventilation.\n7. Follow-Up Measures\nExecutives arrested; plant designated as a priority safety management site. Dedicated extinguishing agents and testing\nstandards for battery factories mandated."}]}
